# Competetive Learning for recognising letters

An unsupervised learning approach to clustering the hand writtent digits/letters from EMNIST dataset. The algorithm implemented is called competetive learning - more details can be found inside the [report](Competetive_Learning_Report.pdf)

## Running the Code:

Simply run `comp_learn.py` withing the provided enviroment to get the best results.
