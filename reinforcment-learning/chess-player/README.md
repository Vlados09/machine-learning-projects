# Reinforcment Learning for Chess

A simple chess RL agent that is able to accurately solve the endgame with only few pices left. The most optimal solution is achieved using Deep Q learning agent. There is also an option to run with SARSA algorithm. See [report](TDRL_Report.pdf) for further technical details and extended experimental results.

## Running the Code
Simply running `chess_student.py` will run a Q-learning algorithm with optimal parameters and henormal initialisation.
 
Running `my_test.py` will partially reproduce the experimental results from the report.
